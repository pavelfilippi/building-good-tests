# building-good-tests
A collection of testing tips and guidelines to help you write the best tests you can

I've aggregated what I think are some of the most important tips and guidelines for writing good tests. Some are specific to `pytest`, though, so they might not apply to your circumstances. They are however, meant to be independent of the type of test you're writing, unless they specifically state what type they are for.

These are meant to be for beginner/novice test writers, to get them started on the right foot. But more advanced tips/guidelines are absolutely welcome. If you have any questions, issues, or suggestions, I would love to hear them, so feel free to make an issue and/or PR.
